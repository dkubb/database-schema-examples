# Database Schema Examples

This repository contains examples for database schemas, grouped by database. Useful whenever we need a real world example, for example for testing [Prisma Introspection](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/introspection) or [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client).

Each example folder contains a `README.md` that contains the link to the original source of the example. It also mentions changes that were applied compared to the original source.
